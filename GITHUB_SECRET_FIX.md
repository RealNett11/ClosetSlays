## GitHub Secret Verification

The issue is that your GitHub secret `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` might still contain a test key instead of a live key.

### Steps to Fix:

1. **Verify GitHub Secret**:
   - Go to https://github.com/RealNett11/ClosetSlays/settings/secrets/actions
   - Check that `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` starts with `pk_live_` not `pk_test_`

2. **If the secret is wrong**:
   - Update it with your actual live publishable key from Stripe Dashboard
   - The live key should start with `pk_live_`

3. **Force rebuild**:
   - After updating the secret, commit this change to trigger a new build

### Current Status:
- ❌ Build is using test key despite live mode
- ❌ GitHub secret may contain test key
- ✅ Workflow is correctly configured to use the secret

### Next Action:
Update the GitHub secret with the correct live key, then commit this file to trigger a rebuild.
